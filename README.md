# ENG471 Analogue Devices
The unit provides an understanding of design, construction, analysis and evaluation of analogue devices. It includes single state Integrated-Circuit Amplifiers, IC biasing, High frequency response of MOSFET and BJT amplifiers, Differential and multistage amplifiers, Amplifiers with active load, Feedback and Operational Amplifiers. The unit includes the critical evaluation of different design methods and integration of knowledge to practical applications.


## Unit Learning Outcomes
1. Critically analyse, design, develop and evaluate analogue circuits that implement linear functions and utilising operational amplifiers.
2. Critically analyse and evaluate the environmental impact of analogue devices and develop solutions to ensure devices are sustainable and appropriate for the social and professional contexts in which they will operate.
3. Contribute as an effective and professional team member in the design, development, construction and evaluation of complex analogue devices.
4. Use effective oral, written, numeric and technical communication methods, including assignment and practical reports, to convey ideas and principles.
